# Weather-Classification
Predicta 1.0 : Leader Board 2nd Place Solution Overview

This problem aims to classify daily weather conditions into one of nine categories using historical weather data from multiple cities. The accurate classification of weather conditions is crucial for various sectors such as public safety, agriculture, and transportation. The methodology involved a comprehensive approach that included data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Through this systematic approach, I identified the best performing algorithms and further enhanced their performance using ensemble techniques and hyperparameter tuning. Key findings from the analysis revealed that the XGBClassifier achieved the highest accuracy, indicating its robustness in handling complex weather patterns.
